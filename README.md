# light-challenge

## Summary

This was made with Next.js. Considering this is an SPA I could've used only React. As the whole React ecosystem tends to be shifting to that direction, I prefer to always start my projects with this framework, given that a real-world project may end up being bigger.

Tailwind is used throughout the project. A lot has been discussed about Tailwind, its benefits and its tradeoffs, I feel more comfortable using it than with external CSS files or CSS-in-JSS.

I installed React-Query as well. This was completely avoidable given we are only using one endpoint and not persisting data, still, same reason as of why I chose Nextjs. 

This is a Next.js project bootstrapped with create-next-app.

## Getting Started
First, install dependencies

```npm install```

Then run the development server:
```
npm run dev

yarn dev
```

## Node Version

Node v18.x is required.

Open http://localhost:3000 with your browser to see the result.

Thanks
